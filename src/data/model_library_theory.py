          'Overview': 'When we have a system with a growth-limiting substate (e.g. the microorganism will end up faster the glucose than other nutrients), the behaviour of the microorganism usually can be describe through the Monod Herbet expression. Here, the microorganism usually has a first order region (and growth fast) and then it stabilize. Afterwards, the death decay defines the rate of death (also a first order here)'
